To update AppHarbor.sln:

  1. Delete the current AppHarbor.sln
  2. Copy file Keyhub.sln to AppHarbor.sln
  3. Open AppHarbor.sln in Visual Studio
     - Remove the Key.Integration.Tests project
	 - Save the solution
	 
AppHarbor.sln is added so that AppHarbor can exclude the integration tests, which can not pass in their environment.
